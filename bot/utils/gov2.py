        """
        Fetches referendum data from a set of URLs using a given referendum ID and network name.

        The function makes HTTP GET requests to each URL in the list. If a response is successful
        and the JSON response contains a non-empty 'title', the function will immediately return
        that response without checking the remaining URLs. If none of the responses are successful,
        the function returns a default response indicating that the referendum details could not
        be retrieved.

        Parameters:
        referendum_id (int): The ID of the referendum to fetch data for.
        network (str): The name of the network where the referendum is held. This is used to
                       construct the URLs and to set the 'x-network' header in the HTTP requests.

        Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the referendum data. This dictionary includes a 'title' key,
              a 'content' key, and a 'successful_url' key. If no successful response is received
              from any of the URLs, the 'title' will be 'None', the 'content' will be a message
              indicating that the details could not be retrieved, and the 'successful_url' will be
              None. Otherwise, the returned dictionary will be the successful JSON response from
              one of the URLs, with a 'successful_url' key added to indicate which URL the
              response came from.
