        Calculate and return the result of a vote based on the numbers of 'aye', 'nay' votes,

        This function takes in the number of 'aye', 'nay' votes, and calculates the percentages
        of each. It then compares the percentage of 'aye' votes to a specified threshold to determine if the
        vote is successful. If the 'aye' percentage is below the threshold, it checks if the 'nay' percentage
        meets the threshold to determine if the vote is unsuccessful. If neither 'aye' nor 'nay' meets the threshold,

        Parameters:
        aye_votes (int): The number of 'aye' votes. Must be non-negative.
        nay_votes (int): The number of 'nay' votes. Must be non-negative.

             unsuccessful, or inconclusive) and the percentages of 'aye', 'nay' votes.

        threads and logs error messages if it lacks permissions or if an invalid thread ID is provided.

        Parameters:
        guild_id (int or str): The ID of the Discord guild (server) where the threads are located.
        message_ids (list or int or str): A single message ID or a list of message IDs corresponding to
