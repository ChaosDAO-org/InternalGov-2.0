    Sets up logging configuration for the application.

    timestamp, the log level, and the log message.

    Parameters:
    verbose (bool, optional): If True, the log level is set to DEBUG, which means more detailed
                              log messages will be recorded. If False (the default), the log level

        Calculate and return the result of a vote based on the numbers of 'aye', 'nay', and 'abstain' votes,

        This function takes in the number of 'aye', 'nay', and 'abstain' votes, and calculates the percentages
        of each. It then compares the percentage of 'aye' votes to a specified threshold to determine if the
        vote is successful. If the 'aye' percentage is below the threshold, it checks if the 'nay' percentage
        meets the threshold to determine if the vote is unsuccessful. If neither 'aye' nor 'nay' meets the threshold,
        the function returns that the vote is inconclusive.

        Parameters:
        aye_votes (int): The number of 'aye' votes. Must be non-negative.
        nay_votes (int): The number of 'nay' votes. Must be non-negative.
        abstain_votes (int): The number of 'abstain' votes. Must be non-negative.

             unsuccessful, or inconclusive) and the percentages of 'aye', 'nay', and 'abstain' votes.

    This function uses the Discord API to interact with the Discord platform. The Discord API provides
    methods for creating a thread and adding reactions to it, as well as accessing information about
    channels and tags.

    The `check_referendums` function from the `OpenGovernance2` class is called to get the new
    referendums. The code then iterates through each new referendum and performs the following actions:

        - Gets the available tags for the Discord channel.
        - Creates a new tag for the origin of the referendum if it doesn't already exist.
        - Creates a new thread for the referendum on the Discord channel, with the title and content
        of the referendum, and the newly created or existing tag.
        - Adds reactions to the thread to allow users to vote on the referendum.

    The loop is set to run every 6 hrs, so the bot will continuously check for new referendums
    and create threads for them on the Discord channel.
