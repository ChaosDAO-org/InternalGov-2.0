## Prereq(s)
#### Installing discord.py
###### Install the latest version of discord.py to interface with threads.

#### Installing PM2
###### PM2 is a daemon process manager that will help you manage and keep your application online 24/7 
`npm install pm2 -g`


## Initial setup
###### Discord API key
1. First, you'll need to create a new application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). If you don't already have an account, you'll need to sign up for one.


2. Once you're logged in to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), click on the "New Application" button in the top right corner. Give your application a name and click "Create".

4. The bot does not need require any Privileged Gateway Intents.


5. Under the "Token" section, click the "Copy" button to copy the API key. This key is what you'll use to authenticate your bot and allow it to interact with the Discord API.

- Manage Roles

- Create Public Threads

- Send Messages in Threads

- Manage Messages

- Manage Threads

NOTE: `Manage Roles` is only needed initially to create the [SYMBOL]-GOV role to notify members to vote. You can either create the role yourself or remove `Manage Roles` permission once the role is created to limit any attack surface. The created role has no inherent permission and is only used for tagging.

7. Be sure to keep your API key secret! Don't share it with anyone or include it in any public code repositories.

###### server / forum id
1. Open Discord and click on the gear icon next to your username in the bottom left corner of your screen.


2. Under App Settings, click Advanced and enable Developer Mode


3. Right-click on your server and copy id. The same step is repeated for the forum channel.


```yaml
discord_api_key: <api-key>
discord_server_id: <server-id>
discord_forum_channel_id: <forum-id>
discord_lock_thread: 14
discord_role: <discord-role/leave blank for anyone to vote>
network: polkadot
token_decimal: 1e10
symbol: DOT
substrate_wss: wss://
```
note: `discord_role` is optional. If left as `null` it will allow anyone to cast a vote.

###### Daemonize the bot to run 24/7 with PM2
```shell
pm2 start main.py --name dotgov2 --interpreter python3
pm2 save
```
