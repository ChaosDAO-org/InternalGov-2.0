## Autonomous voting

When the bot votes is dictated by `/data/vote_periods`. Each origin of a proposal has its own setting on when the first vote should be made & second. A second vote will only be made if the result differs from the first vote. If the first vote is AYE and it remains AYE on the second period then no vote will be made on the network.

> Example:
> > A proposal is submitted with its origin designated as 'Treasurer'. Following a period of five days after its on-chain introduction, a vote is conducted in accordance with the predetermined internal outcome. Should there be a shift in the voting stance from 'AYE' to 'NAY', a subsequent vote will be executed on the tenth day of the proposal's on-chain presence. In instances where the initial decision remains unaltered and the proposal has aged ten days or more, no further on-chain voting action will be undertaken.
