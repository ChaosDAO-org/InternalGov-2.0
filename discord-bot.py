    """A function that checks for new referendums on OpenGovernance2, creates a thread for each new
    referendum on a Discord channel with a specified ID, and adds reactions to the thread.

    This function uses the Discord API to interact with the Discord platform. The Discord API provides
    methods for creating a thread and adding reactions to it, as well as accessing information about
    channels and tags.

    The `check_referendums` function from the `OpenGovernance2` class is called to get the new
    referendums. The code then iterates through each new referendum and performs the following actions:

        1. Gets the available tags for the Discord channel.

        2. Creates a new tag for the origin of the referendum if it doesn't already exist.

        3. Creates a new thread for the referendum on the Discord channel, with the title and content
        of the referendum, and the newly created or existing tag.

        4. Adds reactions to the thread to allow users to vote on the referendum.

    The loop is set to run every 30 minutes, so the bot will continuously check for new referendums
    and create threads for them on the Discord channel.
